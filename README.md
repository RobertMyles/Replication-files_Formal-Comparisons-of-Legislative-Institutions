## Replication files for "Formal Comparisons of Legislative Institutions: Ideal
Points from Brazilian Legislatures"

This repo is for replication of research note "Formal Comparisons of Legislative Institutions: Ideal Points from Brazilian Legislatures", published in the [Brazilian Political Science Review](http://www.bpsr.org.br/index.php/bpsr). The published article is available [here](http://www.scielo.br/pdf/bpsr/v11n1/1981-3821-bpsr-1981-3821201700010007.pdf). The R Markdown file ('[repl_BPSR_RN.Rmd]'()) can be used to replicate the paper, some R code elements take some time to run, and so these can be found in the `\R` folder. 

The original data was taken from the [CEBRAP Legislative Dataset](http://cebrap.org.br/), which used to be available from the Harvard Dataverse, but has been removed. Now these data can be obtained by using the [congressbr](https://github.com/RobertMyles) package for R.
